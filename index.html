                Hi, I'm Thomas, a freelance full-stack software engineer based out of Leuven, Belgium. I prefer working
                together with others to tackle a common goal. My aim is to contribute to solutions which deliver value
                for the end-user. Naturally, I thrive in climates that involve me both in the short and long term vision. I
                enjoy coaching team members, taking time, care and patience to ensure that knowledge is spread
                throughout the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                A creative thinker at the core, I believe time is best spent on those parts of the problem which are
                unique to the task at hand, while leveraging tried and tested solutions. New developments in technology
                intrigue me and I actively keep up with the ever evolving landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can rely on a decade of experience in the field and, as a result, a broad set of skills. Whether it is
                development of a web based SPA (<span class="skill">Vue</span>, <span class="skill">Angular</span>,
                <span class="skill">React</span>, ...), traditional web server (<span class="skill">Node.js</span>,
                <span class="skill">Express</span>, <span class="skill">NestJS</span>, ...) or cloud based architecture
                (<span class="skill">AWS</span>, <span class="skill">Azure</span>, <span class="skill">Google
                    Cloud</span>, ...), I am confident I will bring the required tools and knowledge to the table!
            </p>
